# US-partisanship

Source: from [fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-bipartisanship-doesnt-always-pay-in-three-charts/)

Improved version because I think their charts can be much better

They did not release their source data, so all I could do was to extract the coordinates in their svg file on the page. Thus, **all numbers are relative**
